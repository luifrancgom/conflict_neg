## 

-   This presentation is based on [@program_on_negotiation_three_2008]

# Purpose

##

Discuss negotiation performance, share feedback, and identify key learning points during the debrief

# Resource imbalances and the relationship among the parties

##

- There is a disparity between the resources controlled by each role

    - A control more resources than B
    - B control more resources than C
    
    $$A > B > C$$

- For this reason, roles must be randomly assigned to ensure fairness

# Types of agreements

##

```{r}
#| label: tbl-excluding-c
#| tbl-cap: Agreements excluding C

excluding_c <- tibble(A = c(59, 60, 60, 59),
                      B = c(59, 58, 60, 59),
                      C = c(0 ,  0,  1,  3))

excluding_c |>
  kable(format = "latex", booktabs = TRUE) |>  
  kable_styling(font_size = 15, latex_options = "striped") |> 
  row_spec(row = 0, bold = TRUE)
```

##

```{r}
#| label: tbl-equally-distribution
#| tbl-cap: Agreements which tend to have an equally distribution of points

equally_distribution <- tibble(A = c("121/3", 41, 43),
                               B = c("121/3", 40, 40),
                               C = c("121/3", 40, 38))

equally_distribution |>
  kable(format = "latex", booktabs = TRUE) |>  
  kable_styling(font_size = 15, latex_options = "striped") |> 
  row_spec(row = 0, bold = TRUE)
```

##

```{r}
#| label: tbl-power-distribution
#| tbl-cap: Agreements according to the control of resources

power_distribution <- tibble(A = c(60, 50),
                             B = c(40, 40),
                             C = c(21, 31))

power_distribution |>
  kable(format = "latex", booktabs = TRUE) |>  
  kable_styling(font_size = 15, latex_options = "striped") |> 
  row_spec(row = 0, bold = TRUE)
```

##

- Other agreements

    - A became so greedy so B and C exclude A
    - C blocks the coalition between A and B and chooses to work with A[^1]
    
[^1]: Less common agreement

# Stability of coalitions

# Fairness criteria
