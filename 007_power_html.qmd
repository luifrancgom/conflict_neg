##

- **Purpose**

    - Understand the role of power and the different sources from which this element arises in a negotiation.

# Power in the context of a negotiation

##

-   Power in the context of a negotiation refers to the ability of a negotiator to gain an advantage or increase the likelihood of approaching its target point.

-   Power is important in a negotiation because it generates advantages and allows reaching a settlement point close to the target point.

# Dealing with negotatiors how have more power

## {.smaller}

-   Advice to negotiators who are in low-power positions based on [@lewicki_negociacion_2024, pp. 261-262]:

    -   Diversify risk by entering into deals with several other partners.
    -   Deal with a variety of different individuals and departments in the high-power party (Divide and Conquer).
    -   Build coalitions with other low-power players to increase collective bargaining power.
    -   Enter in early deals with high-power parties and maximize the visibility of those deals to other parties.

## {.smaller}

-   Advice to negotiators who are in low-power positions based on [@lewicki_negociacion_2024, pp. 261-262]:

    -   If you have something to offer, make sure you offer it to more than one high-power party to generate competition between them.
    -   Gather and leverage relevant information to strengthen your negotiation position and achieve better outcomes through persuasive communication.
    -   Do what you can to manage the process (for example the agenda or location) to guide the negotiation towards a more favorable outcome.
