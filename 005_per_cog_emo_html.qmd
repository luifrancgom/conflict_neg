-   Check the message **Welcome greeting** published in the News Bulletin Board.

-   Dear student please edit your profile uploading a photo where your face is clearly visible.

-   The purpose of the virtual meetings is to answer questions and not to make a summary of the study material.

-   This presentation is based on [@lewicki_negociacion_2024, Chapter 6]

##

- **Purpose**

    - Understand how perceptions, knowledge and emotions affect a negotiation process.

# Perception

##

-   **Perception** is defined as the process by which individuals acquire information from their environment through the senses.

    -   Individuals actively construct impressions based on this information, guiding their subsequent behavior

-   The distortions of the perception may occur when the impressions that are generated don't reflect the real aspects of a situation.

    -   This type of distortions are known as **cognitive biases**

##

-   Example of a distortion in perception

# Framing

##

-   **Framing** is a concept initially coined by [@bateson_steps_2000] and developed by [@goffman_frame_1986].

    -   It is defined as the interpretation schemes that individuals use to understand reality and act based on the interpretation they perform.

-   In general terms, this means that individuals have built mental filters throughout their lives that allow them to understand the world. In turn, these mental filters influence the decisions they make.

##

-   Example of how **framing** can change decisions depending on how information is presented [@tversky_framing_1981, p 453]:

    -   **Problem 1** \[N = 152\][^1]: Imagine that the U.S. is preparing for the outbreak of an unusual Asian disease, which is expected to kill 600 people. Two alternative programs to combat the disease have been proposed. Assume that the exact scientific estimate of the consequences of the programs are as follows:

        -   If Program A is adopted, 200 people will be saved. **\[72 percent\]**[^2]
        -   If Program B is adopted, there is 1/3 probability that 600 people will be saved, and 2/3 probability that no people will be saved. **\[28 percent\]**[^3]

    -   Which of the two programs would you favor?

[^1]: Number of people that participate in the experiment

[^2]: Percentage of people that choose Program A

[^3]: Percentage of people that choose Program B

## {.smaller}

-   Example of how **framing** can change decisions depending on how information is presented [@tversky_framing_1981, p 453]:

    -   **Problem 2** \[N = 155\][^4]: The same statement as **Problem 1**

        -   If Program C is adopted, 400 people will die. **\[22 percent\]**[^5]
        -   If Program D is adopted there is 1/3 probability that nobody will die, and 2/3 probability that 600 people will die. **\[78 percent\]**[^6]

    -   Which of the two programs would you favor?

-   **Problem 1** and **Problem 2** are equivalent but they are frame in a different way. This is why the majority choice in **Problem 1** is Program A and for the **Problem 2** is Program D.

[^4]: Number of people that participate in the experiment

[^5]: Percentage of people that choose Program C

[^6]: Percentage of people that choose Program D

##

-   In the field of negotiation you can also influence the perception of the counterpart through framing. An introduction to this topic can be found in [@shonk_framing_2020]:

    -   Offer Manageable Choices [@iyengar_when_2000]
    -   Make Several Offers [@leonardelli_multiple_2019]
    -   Be Willing to Be Rejected [@simonson_choice_1992]

# Cognitive Biases in Negotiation

## {.smaller}

-   A **cognitive bias** is defined as a systematic error that affects the decisions and judgments.

# An alternative approach: Mood and Emotion

##

-   The study of **cognitive biases** in negotiation is focused on how negotiators make judgment errors or how can negotiators can mitigate or eliminate this errors to improve the decision making process.

-   Another approach is to use emotions as a strategic tool in negotiations[^9] by adjusting the negotiation stance based on the other party’s emotional state.

[^9]: As a conflict negotiation professor I am quite bad at using this tool
